## About This Project
We are a group of early career researchers passionate about understanding how social support relationships can buffer stressors to improve health. We are exploring variations of this research theme in the context of critical public health issues including cardiometabolic disease, cognitive decline and sleep deprivation.
Our group is a unique collaboration of diverse early career academics. We believe that mutual support, not competition, will catalyze our ability to conduct rigorous research.

## What is the context of this research?
According to the CDC, the number of Americans aged 65 and older is projected to increase from 58 million in 2022 to 82 million by 2050. While prolonged lifespan is evidence of healthcare advances, caregiver support is crucial to facilitate successful and purposeful ageing. Unpaid caregivers are a critical force within the healthcare system. Adult, middle-aged children comprise the majority of unpaid caregivers and are often best equipped to meet the individualized needs of their care recipients. Demand for elder care is expected to increase sharply with a rise in the number of Americans living with dementia. Currently, there are 7 potential family caregivers per older adult. The CDC estimates that, by 2030, there will be only 4 potential family caregivers per older adult.

## What is the significance of this project?
Caregiving can be a stressful experience, particularly during the years of midlife. Moreover, many caregivers are women who provide support to both aging parents and their own children. Prior work indicates that caregiver stress burden puts caregivers at higher risk of poor psychosocial wellbeing. However, few studies focus on the specific role that caregiving stress plays in cardiometabolic disease cognitive decline. Fewer studies have investigated the moderating effects of perceived purpose and social support on the health risks of caregiving stress.

## What are the goals of the project?
We will address this gap and identify the specific psychosocial stress buffers which moderate health risks in diverse caregiver population. We use secondary data analysis with data from the Midlife in the United States Survey (MIDUS) which includes biomarkers, survey and neuroimaging data sets. We will compare this data to the Milwaukie MIDUS sample which comprised only African American participants. We will use both cross-sectional and longitudinal analysis to determine the moderating effects of social support and perceived life purpose on cardiometabolic risk, sleep quality and cognitive decline. We will report our findings in three publications.
